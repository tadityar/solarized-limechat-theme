# Limechat for OS X Solarized theme

####Overview
This is a theme I created based on (but not limited to) the solarized swatch by [ethanschoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for an open source IRC client [limechat](https://github.com/psychs/limechat).

####Usage
To use this theme you must have the "Menlo Regular" font (exist by default in OS X) and place the files in this repository to the folder [code]Themes[/code]. To find this folder in OS X go to Applications, right-click and choose 'Show package contents'. Then go to the Contents folder and the Themes folder will be there.
