{"name":"Solarized-limechat-theme","tagline":"Limechat for OS X Solarized theme","body":"### What this is.\r\nThis is a theme for an Open Source IRC client for Mac OS X, Limechat. This theme is based on the solarized swatch by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and some off-swatch colors. I actually got inspired to create this theme because of the prolonged use of the solarized theme in [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) ;)\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\n- Install Limechat\r\n    Like of course huh? You can download it [here](http://limechat.net/mac/) if you haven't though.\r\n- Place the theme in the approriate folder\r\n    Download the theme from links above (either the zip or tar file) and copy the extracted files. Open the `Applications` folder and find Limechat there, right-click on it, and choose `Show Packages Content`. Go to `Contents` > `Themes` and paste the copied files there.\r\n- Enable the theme\r\n    If your Limechat app is already running, restart the app and click `Limechat`> `Preferences` > `Theme` and change the `Current Theme` to Solarized. That's it! \r\n\r\n### Create your own theme\r\nI'll post on how to create your own theme in my blog post later. Stay tuned at http://tadityar.ghost.io or http://blog.tadityar.web.id\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTasya Aditya Rukmana (@tadityar) the theme maker, Satoshi Nakagawa (@psychs) the Limechat maker, and [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com) for the Solarized swatch.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the theme?
